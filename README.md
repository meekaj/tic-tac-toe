# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. Play against a computer opponent that makes its moves based on a simple set of rules. The game runs in the console and provides a clear, easy-to-use interface for playing.

## Features

- Play Tic Tac Toe against a computer-controlled opponent.
- Simple and intuitive text-based interface.
- Automatic handling of game conditions like wins, losses, and ties.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher.

## Installation

No additional libraries are required to run. Only the Python standard library.
To play, clone this repository or download the `.py` file.

## How to Play
Run the game using Python from your command line:

Follow the on-screen prompts to make your moves. Input the number corresponding to the position where you want to place your 'X'. The board positions are numbered as follows:

 1 | 2 | 3
-----------
 4 | 5 | 6
-----------
 7 | 8 | 9

## Game Rules
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- You are X, your opponent (the computer) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
